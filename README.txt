In order to use the application you start it up, it will ask you for how many characters you want to play with(1, 2, or 3) then hit enter.
Then it will ask you what map number you'd like, 1 or 2 then hit enter. 
Then it will ask which characters you would like to use if you are playing with one or two players, since you'd use all three available if playing with three.
You can play as Tourist, which is the basic character; Hiker, which can traverse mountains being the highest cost; Or Bogmaster, which can traverse swamps like the back of their hands! With a weight of one.
After selecting your character(s) you will be shown the map with your destination.
You can then choose where to place your character(s) by using coordinates (1,1) to (R,C)example 1 1 enter = (1,1).//BUT DONT CHEAT
